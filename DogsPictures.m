%this is a simple script that displays an image of dogs
%this script is run when the third choice button is selected on the home
%screen
%I wanted to add this sipt because one of the valuabel things I learend in
%this proiject was how to import an image inot a script and display it. I
%needed this skill because I was originally planning on importing an image
%as the menu and using gipout as the selection option to choose each script
%This did not work out but I still wanted to demonstrate the image skill
%and add a little more fun to the final product, so I added this image of
%dogs to the menu options.
