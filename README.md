# ConnectFourGroup
Hi! Our Names are Ashley, Sophie, and Jess. For our group project we 
decided to use Matlab to create an arecade platform that allows players 
to select between playing a two-player game of connect four or tic-tac-toe,
or look at a cute picture of some dogs!

To play the game, you must have two players, both of which will 
share the same computer.
The following are the steps to run the program:
- First, run the script titled "homepage.m"
- Next, select the option you would like to participate in by 
  clicking on the appropriate button

The following instuctions pertain to each individual game:

ConnectFour:
The turns alternate until the board is full or there is a winner. 
A player becomes a winner if they place four chips in a row, either 
horizontally, vertically, or diagonally from left to right or right to left.
- Player one is red, and their chip is a red colored circle.
- Player two is yellow, and their chip is a yellow colored circle.
- Once the game is over the homepage will reappear and you can select 
  to play again, play the other game, or look at pictures of dogs 

TicTacToe:
The turns alternate until the board is full or there is a winner. 
A player becomes a winner if they place three chips in a row, 
either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally from left to to right 
or right to left.
- Player one is red, and their chip is a red colored X
- Player two is blue, and their chip is a blue colored O
- Once the game is over the homepage will reappear and you can select 
  to play again, play the other game, or look at pictures of dogs 

DogPictures:
- enjoy! :)

The object of the both games is to try to acheive a win 
(by placing four chips in a row horiztonally, vertically, or diagonally), 
and prevent the other player from having the ability to win by blocking 
their chips before they can get three or four in a row 
(depending on the game). 

When a player has achived three or four chips in a row 
(depending on the game), the computer will display "Player 1 wins!" 
or "Player 2 wins!", depending on who won the game.
If no player wins and the board is full the game will not permit any 
more turns and will stop. For tic-tac-toe, when there is no winner 
and the board is full the computer will display "Tie". 

Below are two screen recording demonstrations of how to play the game. 
Demonstration One shows a player selecting Connect-Four and Player One 
having a horizontal win.

Demonstration Two shows a player selecting Tic-Tac-Toe and 
Player Two having a diagonal win. 
Demonstration Two:

Originally, we attempted to import a customized photo of a 
homepage menu into MATLAB and use ginput to identify
the appropriate coordinates and discover a click function that would 
allow us to switch from script to script
appropriately. However, this plan did not work and after a lot of 
research we found a MATLAB menu function that
allowed us to use clicks and switch scripts effectively. Howecer, 
this fucntion was not customizable. Therefore,  
we added the DogPhoto option to the menu to add some fun and 
creativity to the project and to display photo
importation skills. 

Enjoy! Thank you!
