# ConnectFourGroup
Hi! Our Names are Ashley, Sophie and Jess. For our group project we decided to use Matlab to create a two-player game of connect four. 

To play the game, you must have two players, both of which will share the same computer. The turns alternate until the board is full or there is a winner. A player becomes a winner if they place four chips in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally from left to right or right to left.
- Player one is magenta, and their chip is a magenta colored "1".
- Player two is yellow, and their chip is a yellow colored "2".

The object of the game is to try to acheive a win (by placing four chips in a row horiztonally, vertically, or diagonally), and prevent the other player from having the ability to win by blocking their chips before they can get four in a row. 

When a player has achived four chips in a row, the computer will display "Player 1 wins!" or "Player 2 wins!", depending on who won the game.
If no player reaches four in a row and the board is full, meaning that each player participated twenty-one times for a total of fourty-two turns, the computer will display "Draw, restart new game".

Below is a screen recording demonstration of how to play the game. The demonstration shows a horizontal win for player one.

To play the game, press the "Run" button in matlab. To place your chip, click on the column in which you would like the chip to fall. Your chip will fall into the approproate place within the column regardless of where you click within the column, similar to a non-digital connect four game where you can only determine the chips' column and not specific location.
