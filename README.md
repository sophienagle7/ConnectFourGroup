# ConnectFourGroup
Hi! Our Names are Ashley, Sophie and Jess, and for our group project we decided tocCreate the game connect four

To play the game, you must have two player, both of which will share the same computer, and alternate turns until the board is full
Player one is magenta and their chip is a magenta 1
Player two is yellow and their chip is a yellow 2

The object of the game is to try to get four of your own chips in a row 
The four can be diagonally, horizontally or vertically

When a player has reached four in a row the computer will display "Player X wins!"
If no player reaches four in a row and the board is full the computer will display "Draw, restart new game"
